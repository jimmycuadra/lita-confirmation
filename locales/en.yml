          Hi %{user_name},

          You are now enrolled into two factor confirmation. Your secret code is %{secret}.
          Use the code with any TOTP application such as Google Authenticator
          to generate one-time passwords. Thank you for improving security!

          Many applications (including Google Authenticator) can import the secret
          from the QR code attached to this message.

          Yours,
          --
